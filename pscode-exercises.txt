// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
NUMBER s1, s2, sum
OUTPUT("Input number1:")
INPUT s1
OUTPUT("Input number2:") 
INPUT s2
sum=s1+s2
OUTPUT sum
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

INPUT ni
remainder = n % 2.
IF remainder is not equal to 0.
answer = odd.
ELSE.
answer = even.
OUTPUT answer.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5

small = n1

large = n1

for i = 2 to 5:

   if n1 > ni then:

       small = ni

   if n1 < ni: then:

       large = ni

print("Average:", avg)

print("Smallest:", small)

print("Largest:", large)
