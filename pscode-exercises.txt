// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

START
INPUT x, y
SUM x + y
OUTPUT sum result 
STOP

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Reminders: The modulo operation (abbreviated “mod”, or “%” in many programming languages) is the remainder when dividing.
When a number is divided by 2 and get zero in remaining then that number is even number and when we get some value in remaining then it is called odd numbers.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

START
INPUT x1, x2, x3, x4, x5
AVG = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)/5
for i = 2 to 5:
   if x1 > xi then:
       smallest = ni
   if x1 < xi: then:
       largest = ni
REPEAT Logic for x2, x3, x4 and x5
PRINT("Average:", avg result)
PRINT("Smallest:", smallest result)
PRINT("Largest:", largest result)
STOP
